SqlStream is an ADO.NET library intended to support Table-Valued Parameters (TVP) which were introduced in Sql Server 2008. The purpose is to provide support for TVPs with minimal setup and to be able to use TVPs as if you were writing to System.IO.Stream. 

While it is not actually possible to implement a class that inherits from System.IO.Stream, the semantics employed by SqlStream are the same.

For background see the <a href="http://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/SQL+Server+2008/66554/">Sql Server Central article</a> that inspired this project.

To see how it is used, open the solution file (VS 2010), set SqlServerStreamTests as the startup project, hit F5 or click Debug -> Start Debugging, then once the NUnit GUI loads click "Run".

To actually use this library in a project you'll need to define the following:

1) A Sql Server User Defined Type (UDT): This will act as the TVP for your stored procedure.
2) A Stored Procedure which has one parameter which is the UDT you defined in step #1.
3) A .NET class in your client application that implements ISqlStreamRecord.
